Growth Mindset Notes:

Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

- Deliberate practice can be summarized as:
  Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.
- The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
  - Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
  - Repeated often
  - Feedback on results in continuously available
  - It's highly demanding mentally
  - It's difficult
  - It requires good goals
- Look for activities to push you to work on areas of building that you aren’t good at!

Carol Dweck on the Grown Mindset

- Avoid the fixed mind-set and cling to the growth mind-set. Now vs yet
- How do we get to :yet”
  - Praise Wisely
  - Rewarding Yet
  - Process wisely
  - Change mindsets
- The “yet” in the class room encourages equality

Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
_ Girt is passion and perseverance for long term goals.
_ Grit is a marathon not a sprint
_ Grittier ppl are destined to be more successful regardless of IQ
_ Git is unrelated to measuring talent

Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- Snobbery is a global crisis and phenomenon.
- Meritocracy society is one that basically states that if you have talent energy and skill you should get to the top and those at the bottom are “supposed” to be there.
- You can’t be successful at everything
- Make sure our ideas of success are our own and not of those around you

Emotional Intelligence
Self Awareness: 19 Self Management: 17
Social Awareness: 24 Relationship Management: 21
I scored the highest in social awareness and the lowest in Self Management at a 17. Given the interpretation of the score my Self Awareness is only 1 point but my Self Management at a 17 could definitely use some work. To be honest, I am not surprised that I am struggling more with the self aspect of this emotional intelligence quiz. On a personal level, I believe I focus on the way others perceive me and how I perceive in attempts not to cross or offend them but I should work on navigating what is going on within myself first and then that will reflect in action and emotion towards others. Whether this is an outcome of society, my upbringing or some other factor or maybe a combination of different things, I think we all could do a little work with caring more about the introspective self vs what we show outwardly to others.

Biases
My final result is a 105/120. This indicates you have high self awareness, curiosity, and courage. But this is not a topic you ever master. My strongest areas are all tied at 15:

- bias and identity
- Empathy and curiosity
- Meaningful connection
- Effective courage
  My weakest areas are :
- Fours ways to act (9)
- Bias and the brain (11)
- Connection to mitigate bias (11)
  In the coming weeks and beyond I will focus on my lowest score area which is four ways to act on courage which is surprising considering I am in multiple affinity networks in my professional life and have been a leader in this space over the last year and a half specifically in the groups of Queer POC and the Transgender advocacy teams for Zillow Group.
